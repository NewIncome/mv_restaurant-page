# Restaurant Page
This project has the purpose of building a restaurant page, with no initial html, thus rendered dynamically using the package manager 'npm', according to the requirements listed in [The Odin Project library project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page).
